## Rugs for stairs ##

- They snap to the middle of the stairs, but they also have an option to snap together.
- They work perfectly with Marble, Graustein and modded stairs, but with stone stairs they sometimes glitch through, as the stone stairs vibrate when placed and change shape. I tried to match them as much as possible to the stone stairs, but even with all these efforts they still find a corner to glitch through.
